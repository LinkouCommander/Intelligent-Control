This Repository contains coursework of NCKU N25C900 Special Topics on Intelligent Control, taught by Prof. Tzuu-Hseng S. Li.

Abstract:
* Conducted a merge analysis between **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**, **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**, and **Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)** algorithms for the optimization of benchmark functions
* Designed a **PID controller** optimized by **PSO** to enable the closed-loop discrete system to accurately track a rectangular command signal
